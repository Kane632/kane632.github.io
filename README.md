# My Personal Site

This repository contains the source code for my personal website, built with the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). It serves as a central hub for my posts, random thoughts, homelab experiments, and portfolioâ€”all in one place.

## What You'll Find Here
- Blog posts and updates
- Technical notes and random thoughts
- Homelab and self-hosting experiments
- My game development and software portfolio

This site is based on a fork of the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll template, customized to fit my needs and style. If you're interested in building a similar site, check out the [Minimal Mistakes documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/).
