Welcome to my new site! This website is built using the excellent [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll template](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).

Here you'll find a collection of my posts, random thoughts, homelab experiments, and my portfolio, all in one place. My goal is to share my experiences, projects, and ideas, whether they're related to game development, technology, or anything else that sparks my interest.

Stay tuned for updates and new content!
