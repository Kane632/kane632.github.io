<p align='justify'>
I'm a senior Unreal Engine generalist programmer with a strong focus on networking and optimization. I thrive on solving complex problems across the entire tech stack, whether it's fine-tuning performance, building robust multiplayer systems, or getting the backend talking seamlessly with the game.<br><br>

Over the years, I’ve tackled a wide range of tasks: from designing clean, functional UI widgets to integrating third-party SDKs like PlayFab and GameLift. My goal is always the same, ship reliable, scalable systems that just work.<br><br>

Outside of Unreal, I’m a tech tinkerer at heart. I enjoy scripting with AutoHotKey, Python, and JavaScript to build useful tools and streamline workflows. One of my personal projects is <a href="https://github.com/Kane632/ScreenDeck">Screen Deck</a>, a fully customizable AHK-based alternative to the Stream Deck, affordable, lightweight, and tailored to my needs.<br><br>

At work, I’ve also built tools to empower teams. One project involved creating a React + Electron dashboard that allowed us to mint and distribute in-game NFTs, a good example of how I bridge gameplay systems with external services and tools.<br><br>

I’m always up for new challenges, and I take pride in being the kind of developer who can jump into any part of the pipeline and make an impact.</p>
