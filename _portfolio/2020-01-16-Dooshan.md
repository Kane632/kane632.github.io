<p align="justify">
This was my Master's project within a one year time frame. It also was my first big game project a part of small side projects or gamejams.<br><br>

We started making a custom engine and when we had some basic foundations like rendering and input, we started making the game.<br>

From that point forwards we worked on both the engine and the game more or less at the same time.<br><br>

This project is a 3rd person intense shooter with three weapons where each one has two fire modes, and a total of four different types of enemies. You need to master each one and use it in the correct situation to survive the horde of demons!<br><br>

The game was made by a team of four programmers and three artists with the help and knowledge of teachers at UPF.  
</p>

In order to ease and speed up the game production some tools were made like:  
- An exporter of yEd graphs to our engine's Behaviour Trees system.
- Custom particle system editor made with ImGui.
- A collection of MaxScript tools to export models, materials and animations from within 3DS Max into the engine.
- Integrated SOL2 in order to use LUA as a scripting language for faster iterations.

### Technologies used
- DirectX & DirectXTK for rendering.
- [FMOD](https://www.fmod.com/) for audio.
- [SOL2](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2) as a scripting language.
- [HLSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl) as shader language.
- C++ as the base that glues everything together.
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) 2019.
- [Gitkraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/).
- [Autodesk 3DS Max](https://www.autodesk.com/products/3ds-max/overview) as the 3D mesh and animation editor.
- [Substance painter](https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d/apps/painter.html) as texture editor.
- [Maxscript](https://help.autodesk.com/view/MAXDEV/2024/ENU/?guid=MAXDEV_Overview_overview_maxscript_html) to make tools for artists and exporter into the engine.
