<p align="justify">
This was my first ever project made in Unreal Engine.<br><br>
The game consists on a tank that is controlled by the player. The player will need to kill all the turrets to win, or if he dies in the process he will lose.<br><br>
I learned the basics of creating actors/pawns from C++ and attaching components before making the final touches in a child Blueprint class. I also modified the project settings input for the first time and assigned bindings.<br><br>
I found interesting how Unreal Engine has already a game framework setup with base classes like the game mode, game state, player controller, player state, pawn, hud, game instance, etc. Coming from my custom engine and some small Unity projects this was quite puzzling and complex at first, but in the end I liked how it was structured.
