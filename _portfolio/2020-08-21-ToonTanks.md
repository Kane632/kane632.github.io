<p align="justify">
This was my first ever project made in Unreal Engine.<br><br>
The game consists on a tank that is controlled by the player. The player will need to kill all the turrets to win, or if he dies in the process he will lose.<br><br>
I learned the basics of creating actors/pawns from C++ and attaching components before making the final touches in a child Blueprint class. I also modified the project settings input for the first time and assigned bindings.<br><br>
