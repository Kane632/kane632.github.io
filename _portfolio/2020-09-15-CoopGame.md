<p align='justify'>
My second multiplayer project in Unreal.<br><br>
This game works as a horde mode. When you kill all the enemies, a new wave comes and it's currently endless.<br>
If any of the players die within a wave, they respawn automatically at the start of the next, if the other players manage to win that round.<br><br>
This time the replication was more complex than the previous project, and a lot of the actions were run on the server so the clients couldn't cheat so easily. I used some replicated variables and also introduced some RPCs or multicast functions to sync all the effects on the clients.<br>
I also created a GameState so it was easier to sync the status of the game to all the clients.<br><br>
I used for the first time the Environment Query System from Unreal and it has proved quite useful. With it I can spawn the enemies at better locations, or the AI can run to cover and heal themselves when they have low health.<br><br>
One of the tutorial challenges was the creation of one pickup that boosts the player and in the end I made three along the tutorial: Speed, health regeneration and Immortality.<br><br>
Finally, as a self-imposed challenge I wanted to run the game in a dedicated server, so packaging it has been a small but fun ride. Getting the Unreal Engine source code, compiling it, and then rebase the project to my Unreal source version so I could package the dedicated server had its small challenges.<br>
In the end when I could connect to my server using my public IP address it made all the work worth it.</p>
